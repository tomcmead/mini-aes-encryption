# mini-aes-encryption
Mini-AES has all the parameters of AES significantly reduced while at the same time preserving its original structure. It is
meant to be a purely educational cipher and is not considered secure for actual applications.
The purpose is such that once undergraduate students and amateur cryptanalysts have grasped
the basic principles behind how Mini-AES works, it will be easy for them to move on to the
real AES.
